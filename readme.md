# Problem Statement (Command Design Pattern)

Design a simple Smart Home Remote Control system that can manage appliances like Lights and Fans. Users can perform operations like turning a light ON/OFF or starting/stopping a fan. Over time, the system needs to support additional features like:

Undo/Redo functionality.
Executing a sequence of commands (macro commands).
Adding new devices without modifying the remote control code.
